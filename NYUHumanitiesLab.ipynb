    "Still esoteric, but more organized. A piece of JSON data relates keys to values, much like how a phone book relates names to phone numbers. But what do the values mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "Whelp, one of the unfortunate things about JSON is that, while the _format_ is universally understood, the _meanings_ for keys and values are not standardized across the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, for example, the Internet Archive somewhat curiously decided that \"created\" should refer to when the request was first made, as seconds since midnight, January 1st, 1970 (or what is called the [Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)). So that ```1448448826``` refers to Wed, 25 Nov 2015 10:53:46. If Bard's library were to implement a JSON API for their collections, they might decide to use the key \"created\" to refer to when the item was first uploaded, or first published, or first acquired. Facebook might use \"created\" to refer to when a particular user first joined Facebook, or when a user was born. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that, while JSON is great for getting information from Web Point A to Web Point B, there's still the need to process and interpret that information according to how the publisher meant for it to be interpreted."
